# LinAlgLib is a Python library for Linear Algebra computations.

## Installation

The LinAlgLib library can be installed from either the official PyPI or limited beta versions using the test PyPI using PIP. If you are not familiar with the difference please use the official PyPI installation.

- You can install the official LinAlgLib library from PyPI:

```bash
pip install LinAlgLib --upgrade
```

- To install from TestPyPI, you can use:

```bash
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ LinAlgLib --upgrade
```

## Use

Following installation, you can import LinAlgLib using the following command.

```bash
import LinAlgLib.functions as lal
```

If you are not familiar with the available functions in this library, there is a help command available. The functions have been split into sections to follow a general course outline. The help function can be run using **help()** to see all functions or passed an integer between 1 and 4 to show the functions specifically for that quater of the course.
